## Project Details

Some points of interest about the project project structure:

- `app/components` - custom React components should go here
- `app/styles` - styles added here won't be treated as CSS Modules, so any global classes or library styles should go here
- `app/layout` - the `AppLayout` component can be found here which hosts page contents within itself; additional sidebars and navbars should be placed in `./components/` subdir.
- `app/colors.js` - exports an object with all of the defined colors by the Dashboard. Useful for styling JS based components - for example charts.
- `app/routes` - PageComponents should be defined here, and imported via `index.js`. More details on that later.
